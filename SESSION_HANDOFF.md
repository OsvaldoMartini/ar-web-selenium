# Session Handoff

## Current checkpoint - 2026-08-08

The dated 2026-07-15 scanner-removal notes below remain historical backlog. The authoritative Page
Mappings delivery checkpoint is:

- P0-P4 and all 12 review-remediation findings are implemented and pushed.
- P5 cache-first scanning is implemented and pushed: backend `c8e722cd` plus correction `823ab2dc`;
  frontend `14b7832`.
- P6 safe runtime healing is implemented and pushed in backend `668a7acb`.
- The P7 OCR Review core is implemented and pushed: backend `89bbce24`; frontend `4dc51aa`.
- P7 reads the selected immutable READY capture and atomically applies owner/page/revision-scoped
  `client_named` changes. The frontend keeps OCR Review isolated inside Page Mappings.
- `GridItem` and `GridItemScann` were not modified or staged by the P5-P7 work. The legacy
  `GridItemScann` OCR Results launcher and old `ocr-results-*` route/session/component retirement
  remain parked until the concurrent Grid work finishes and parity verification is permitted.
- The final authorized `mvn compile` passed with 555 main Java sources. No tests were created or run
  for P5-P7 under the explicit user pause.
- Focused frontend lint for the Page Mappings OCR files passed with 0 errors and one existing
  `captureElements` hook-dependency warning.
- No P5-P7 frontend production build or resource mirror was performed because it would include
  concurrent uncommitted Grid changes. The backend was not packaged or restarted.
- Migration application, real SQL Server inspection, deployment health, and live desktop/browser
  acceptance remain open operational gates.
- Explicit private Windows capture-folder ACL enforcement and configured snapshot retention/pin/purge
  remain open security/lifecycle roadmap work.
- Unrelated dirty Grid, generated-resource, Claude-settings, Marketing, and screenshot files remain
  preserved and outside the Page Mappings commits.

## Current Goal

Continue the Scanner / AR Web Factory migration removal.

Direction from the user:

- Keep Java as the minimal backend/service side.
- Move scanner frontend logic into the React/TypeScript container.
- Create/extract new TypeScript methods/functions and typed WebSocket contracts.
- Test with Playwright/browser validation as much as possible when the app can launch cleanly.
- For each medium migration modification, commit and push.
- Do not change frontend design unless required for the migration.

## Files To Read First

Read these first before continuing:

1. Frontend active dirty slice:
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\GridItemScannMobile.tsx`
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\scanner\Scanner.operations.ts`
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\scanner\Scanner.sessions.ts`
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\scanner\Scanner.controllerStatus.ts`
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\scanner\Scanner.controllerTiming.ts`

2. Frontend scanner comparison files:
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\GridItemScann.tsx`
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\GridItem.tsx`
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\GridItemComp.tsx`
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\index.tsx`
   - `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\scanner\*.test.ts`

3. Backend scanner contract/constants:
   - `src/main/java/com/allinweb/ch/scanner/ScannerWorkspaceOperations.java`
   - `src/main/java/com/allinweb/ch/scanner/ScannerWorkspaceSessions.java`
   - `src/main/java/com/allinweb/ch/scanner/ScannerWorkspacePayloads.java`
   - `src/test/java/com/allinweb/ch/scanner/ScannerWorkspaceOperationsTest.java`
   - `src/test/java/com/allinweb/ch/scanner/ScannerWorkspaceSessionsTest.java`

4. Backend biggest remaining runtime cleanup:
   - `src/main/java/com/allinweb/ch/websocket/SimpleWebSocketServer.java`

5. JavaFX legacy scanner files:
   - `src/main/java/com/allinweb/ch/component/pane/ARScannedElementPane.java`
   - `src/main/java/com/allinweb/ch/component/scene/ARScannedElementScene.java`

6. Smaller backend cleanup targets:

## What Is Missing To Finish

### 1. Finish The Current Frontend Mobile Scanner Slice

Current active file:

- `D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\GridItemScannMobile.tsx`

Next actions:

- Review the current diff in `GridItemScannMobile.tsx`.
- Replace remaining scanner operation/session literals where safe.
- Prefer existing constants from:
  - `Scanner.operations.ts`
  - `Scanner.sessions.ts`
- Likely remaining safe replacement:
  - replace runtime `searchTerms` operation checks with `SCANNER_SEARCH_TERMS_OPERATION`
- Keep payload field names such as JSON property `searchTerms` only where they are actual wire payload keys.
- Run frontend scanner tests and build.
- Commit and push this slice.

Suggested commands:

```powershell
git -C D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid diff -- src/components/GridItemScannMobile.tsx
rg -n -C 3 "searchTerms|scannerTool|scannerGrid|preScannerGrid|scanner-element-pane" D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid\src\components\GridItemScannMobile.tsx
npm test -- --watchAll=false src/components/scanner
npm run build
git -C D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid diff --check
git -C D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid add src/components/GridItemScannMobile.tsx
git -C D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid commit -m "refactor: reuse scanner operation id in mobile grid"
git -C D:\Projects\ar-react-ts-grid push origin VERSION-4.6
```

### 2. Backend WebSocket Server Cleanup

Biggest remaining backend runtime file:

- `src/main/java/com/allinweb/ch/websocket/SimpleWebSocketServer.java`

Known runtime literals still to clean carefully:

- `scannerGrid`
- `preScannerGrid`
- `scannerTool`
- `scanner-element-pane`

Likely work:

- Reuse `ScannerWorkspaceSessions.SCANNER_GRID`.
- Reuse `ScannerWorkspaceSessions.PRE_SCANNER_GRID`.
- Reuse `ScannerWorkspaceSessions.SCANNER_TOOL`.
- Add `ScannerWorkspaceSessions.SCANNER_ELEMENT_PANE = "scanner-element-pane"` if it does not exist yet.
- Update `ScannerWorkspaceSessionsTest`.
- Replace exact string comparisons and sends first.
- Be careful with regex checks such as `matches(".*scannerTool.*")`; replace with helper methods or constant-based contains logic only when behavior is identical.
- Keep compatibility destinations until React owns the replacement route.

Suggested focused tests after this slice:

```powershell
& 'D:\Installed\apache-maven-3.9.16\bin\mvn.cmd' '-Dtest=ScannerWorkspaceSessionsTest,ScannerWorkspaceOperationsTest,ScannerWorkspaceServiceTest,ScannerWorkspaceRequestLedgerTest,ScannerWorkspaceRequestTest,ScannerWorkspaceResponseTest' test
git diff --check
```

### 3. JavaFX Legacy Scanner Pane Cleanup

The big Java-side migration target remains:

- `src/main/java/com/allinweb/ch/component/pane/ARScannedElementPane.java`

This file is large and behavior-sensitive. Split it into small safe commits.

Known cleanup areas:

- Old scanner WebSocket sends.
- Hardcoded scanner session destinations.
- Direct JavaFX control state mixed with scanner business logic.
- Browser/tab/DOM operations.
- TEST RUN / STOP and terminal-result behavior.
- Block creation and persistence glue.
- Appium/Web XML parsing and scan DTO construction.
- OCR, filesystem/CSV, support, and plugin management.

Do not start by deleting or rewriting the large execution engine. First extract small service/context boundaries and preserve behavior.

### 4. Small Backend Cleanup

After `SimpleWebSocketServer.java`, continue with smaller files that still contain scanner/session/searchTerms literals or old Java-side contract knowledge:

- `ARScannedElementScene.java`
- `GenFlowService.java`
- `PerformLists.java`
- `PerformListElements.java`
- `PerformPreLoad.java`
- `PerformCloseBrowser.java`
- `PluginContext.java`
- `ScannerWorkspacePayloads.java`
- `BotJobDetailsWorkspaceHost.java`

Keep these changes small and commit each medium slice.

### 5. Tests Cleanup

Some tests still hardcode scanner contract values:

- `scannerGrid`
- `preScannerGrid`
- `scannerTool`
- `scanner-element-pane`
- `searchTerms`

This is lower risk than runtime code. Update tests after runtime constants are stable.

Prioritize tests that validate new constants:

- `ScannerWorkspaceOperationsTest`
- `ScannerWorkspaceSessionsTest`
- frontend scanner contract/helper tests under `src/components/scanner`

### 6. End-To-End Validation

Required final validation path:

- Full frontend build.
- Focused frontend scanner tests.
- Focused backend Maven scanner tests.
- Backend compile/package when practical.
- Playwright/browser validation if the app can be launched cleanly.

Do not claim scanner pane/scene retirement until:

- Runtime routes are migrated or compatibility-routed.
- React owns the reachable scanner controls.
- Java side is reduced to services/backends.
- Zero-reference audit confirms `ARScannedElementPane` and `ARScannedElementScene` can be deleted.
- Desktop runtime parity is recorded.

## Already Completed In This Migration Pass

Frontend extraction/cleanup already pushed:

- scanner response matching helpers
- scanner action status helpers
- bootstrap/action response handling helpers
- transport message builder
- controller reset state helper
- bootstrap/action request eligibility helpers
- message cursor helper
- request id formatting helper
- controller failure statuses
- controller timing
- baseline statuses
- scanner operation constants
- scanner session constants
- scanner compatibility ids
- app routing and grid message reuse of scanner session constants

Backend extraction/cleanup already pushed:

- scanner request body parser
- scanner workspace operation ids
- scanner workspace session ids
- pre scan workspace session reuse
- scanner search terms operation constant
- browser service scanner constant reuse
- pre scan host scanner operation id reuse
- scanner contract constant test reuse

## Recent Verification

Frontend recent verification:

- `npm test -- --watchAll=false src/components/scanner`
  - previously passed: 19 suites / 70 tests
  - known warnings: React `act` deprecation, CRA Babel preset warning, worker force-exited warning
- `npm run build`
  - previously passed
  - known existing ESLint warnings in unrelated files

Backend recent verification:

- Focused Maven scanner/service tests previously passed.
- Known Maven warnings:
  - duplicate `javafx-maven-plugin`
  - deprecation/unchecked compile warnings

## Current Important Caution

The frontend file `GridItemScannMobile.tsx` is already modified. Read and preserve that diff before editing.

Do not change frontend CSS/design while doing the scanner contract cleanup unless a functional migration requires it.
